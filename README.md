## Description

A text editor that runs in the browser, following PWA principles. Users can use this application through the deployed link and download it to their computer by clicking the Install button.

Text editors are useful for changing files such as configuration files, documentation files and programming language source code. This application meets the PWA criteria and features a number of data persistence techniques, including IndexedDB, a registered service worker, and a manifest file.

Modifying this code to meet PWA principles was a great learning experience for me. I was able to understand how many of the tools and technologies used to create PWAs can be leveraged to help improve application performance and accessibility.
